		This method is designed to produce very clear and informative logging and failure reasons if the assertion is 
		unsuccessful (using the `logValueDiff` method). 
		
		Example usage::
		
			# Equality comparison of an 'actual' vs 'expected' message from when our server started; 
			# note the use of a descriptive name for the 'actualXXX=' keyword to produce a nice clear message if it fails
			self.assertThat("actualStartupMessage == expected", expected='Started successfully', actualStartupMessage=msg)
			
			# This produces the self-describing log messages like: 
			#   Assert that (actualStartupMessage == expected) with expected='Started successfully', actualStartupMessage='Started unsuccessfully' ... passed

			# Always design tests to give clear messages if there's a failure. Here's an example of adding an extra 
			# parameter (fromLogFile) that's not used in the condition string, to indicate which server we're testing here
			self.assertThat('actualUser == expected', expected='myuser', actualUser=user, fromLogFile='server1.log')

			# Any valid Python expression is permitted (not only equality testing):
			self.assertThat("actualStartupMessage.endswith('successfully')", actualStartupMessage=msg)
			self.assertThat("re.match(expected, actualStartupMessage)", expected=".* successfully", actualStartupMessage=msg)
			self.assertThat("(0 <= actualValue < max) and type(actualValue)!=float", actualValue=v, max=100)

			# Use ``is`` for comparisons to True/False/None as in Python ``==``/``!=`` don't always do what you'd 
			# expect for these types. 
			self.assertThat("actualValue is not None", actualValue=v)
			
		This method is powerful enough for almost any validation that the other assert methods don't 
		handle, and by enforcing the discipline of naming values it generates self-describing log messages and 
		outcome reasons to make it really obvious what is going on.
		For best results, make sure that your keyword= parameters have clear and unique names so it's obvious 
		how each assertThat() differs from the other ones, and ensure that all values you're going to want to see 
		are included as one of the named parameter values (rather than buried deep inside the main conditionstring). 
		
		The condition string is just a Python expression, which will be passed to ``eval()`` and can use any 
		of the ``keyword=`` argument values passed to this method (but not the caller's local variables).
		The evaluation is performed in a namespace that also includes the current `BaseTest` instance (``self``), 
		some standard Python modules (``os.path``, ``math``, ``sys``, ``re``, ``json``, and ``locale``), the `pysys` module, and 
		the contents of the `pysys.constants` module, e.g. ``IS_WINDOWS``. If necessary, symbols for additional modules 
		can be imported dynamically using ``import_module()``. For example::

			self.assertThat("IS_WINDOWS or re.match(expected, actual)", actual="foo", expected="f.*")
			self.assertThat("import_module('tarfile').is_tarfile(self.output+file) is False", file='/foo.zip')
		
		Sometimes the differences between assertThat expressions are hard to describe in the parameter names themselves, 
		and for these cases you can get self-describing behaviour with a parameter ending in the suffix 
		``__eval`` whose value is itself a Python expression to be evaluated, using any local variable in the 
		namespace of the calling code, for example::
		
			myDataStructure = ...
			self.assertThat("actual == expected", actual__eval="myDataStructure['item1'][-1].getId()", expected="foo")
			self.assertThat("actual == expected", actual__eval="myDataStructure['item2'][-1].getId()", expected="bar")
			self.assertThat("actual == expected", actual__eval="myDataStructure['item3'][-1].getId()", expected="baz")

			# Produces self-describing log messages like this:
			# Assert that {actual == expected} with actual{=myDataStructure['item1'][-1].getId()} ="foo" expected="foo" ... passed
			# Assert that {actual == expected} with actual{=myDataStructure['item2'][-1].getId()} ="bar" expected="bar" ... passed
			# Assert that {actual == expected} with actual{=myDataStructure['item3'][-1].getId()} ="baZaar" expected="baz" ... failed [run.py:123]
			#       actual: 'baZaar'
			#     expected: 'baz'
			#                 ^
		
		As shown above, when (at least) two named parameters are provided and the condition string is a simple 
		comparison using exactly two of the parameters, additional lines are logged if the 
		assertion fails, showing at what point the two arguments differ (based on finding the longest common substring). 
		So it's a good idea to include both the actual and expected value as named parameters rather than as literals 
		inside the condition string. 
		
		.. versionchanged:: 1.5.1
			The ability to pass named keyword= parameters was added in 1.5.1 
			(prior to that this method was deprecated).
		
		:param str conditionstring: A string containing Python code that will be evaluated using ``eval()`` 
			as a boolean expression, for example ``actualXXX == expected``, where XXX is a brief description of 
			what value is being tested. 
			
			It's best to put expected values into a separate named parameter (rather than using literals inside the 
			conditionstring), since this will produce more informative messages if there is a failure. 
			
			Do not be tempted to use a Python f-string here, as that would deprive this method of the 
			opportunity to provide a self-describing message and outcome reason. 
		
		:param \**kwargs: All additional keyword arguments are treated as values which will be made available 
			when evaluating the condition string. Any keyword ending in the special suffix ``__eval`` will be treated 
			as a Python expression string (rather than a string literal) and will be be evaluated in a namespace 
			containing the local variables of the calling code and any preceding named parameters.  

		:param \*positional_arguments: (deprecated) Unnamed positional arguments will be 
			substituted into the condition string using the old ``%`` format string mechanism, before it is evaluated. 
			This feature is deprecated as it provides poor diagnostic information, requires string parameters to be 
			explicitly escaped using ``repr()``, and only permits stringifiable 
			data structures to be used by the conditionstring. Instead use named ``keyword=`` in all new tests. 
		
		:param failureOutcome=FAILED: The outcome that will be added if the condition fails. For example you could 
			set this to `pysys.constants.BADPERF` for a performance assertion. Added in PySys v2.1. 
		
		:param abortOnError=False: Set to True to make the test immediately abort if the
			assertion fails. By default this method produces a BLOCKED output 
			but does not throw if the eval(...) cannot be executed. 

		:param str assertMessage='': A high-level description of what the assertion is achieving, used in log messages and 
			the outcome reason. For example "Check the startup logging". Alternatively, to add some *additional* 
			information to the default message message (e.g. which file/server it pertains to etc), just add the info as 
			a string value with an extra keyword argument e.g. ``server="server1"``.

		"""Perform a validation by comparing the contents of two text files, typically a file from the 
		output directory against a file in the ``<testdir>/Reference/`` directory containing the expected output.

		Differences in line ending are always ignored, and depending on the value of ``stripWhitespace`` leading 
		and trailing whitespace may also be ignored. 
		
		The files can be pre-processed prior to the comparison to either ignore particular lines, 
		sort their constituent lines, replace matches to regular 
		expressions in a line with an alternate value, or to only include particular lines. 
		However, it is often easier to instead use 
		`copy` to perform the transformations (e.g. stripping out timestamps, finding lines of interest etc)
		and then separately call assertDiff on the file generated by copy. This makes it easier to generate a suitable 
		reference file and to diagnose test failures. For example::
		
			self.assertDiff(self.copy('myfile.txt', 'myfile-processed.txt', mappers=[RegexReplace(RegexReplace.DATETIME_REGEX, '<timestamp>')])))
		
		The above example shows a very compact form of assertDiff, which uses the fact that copy() returns 
		the path of the destination file, and that there is no need to specify assertDiff's file2 (reference) 
		parameter if it's the same basename as the first argument (just located in a different directory). In practice 
		it's very convenient to use the same basename for both the reference file and the output file it's compared to. 
		
		Should the files after pre-processing be equivalent a C{PASSED} outcome is added to the test outcome list, 
		otherwise a C{FAILED} outcome is added.
		
		If you have any serialized dictionary/map data structures in the comparison files, or any lists that come from 
		a directory listing, be really careful to ensure there is deterministic sorting of the keys/filenames, as 
		by default the ordering is often subject to unpredictable changes when upgrading tools or switching between 
		OSes, and you don't want to have to update lots of testcases every time the sorting changes. If you are able 
		to get the data into a Python data structure (e.g. by serializing from JSON), 
		Python's ``json.dump(..., sort_keys=True)`` can be a convenient way to produce a predictable order for 
		dictionary keys.
		
		If you have a large set of test reference files which need to be updated after a behaviour or output formatting 
		change, you can use a special command line option which makes ``assertDiff`` overwrite the reference files with 
		a copy of the actual comparison file in cases where the diff would otherwise fail. 
		Use this feature with caution, since it overwrites reference files with no backup. In 
		particular, make sure you have committed all reference files to version control before running the command, and 
		the afterwards be sure to carefully check the resulting diff to make sure the changes were as expected before 
		committing. To use 
		this feature, run::
		
			pysys.py run -XautoUpdateAssertDiffReferences
		
		:param str file1: The actual (or first) file to be compared; can be an absolute path or relative to the test output directory. 
		:param str file2: The expected/reference (or second) file to be compared; can be an absolute path or relative to the Reference directory.
			The default is for file2 to be the same basename as file1 (but located in the Reference/ directory). 
		:param str filedir1: The dirname of the first file (defaults to the testcase output subdirectory)
		:param str filedir2: The dirname of the second file (defaults to the testcase reference directory)
		:param list[str] ignores: A list of regular expressions used to denote lines in the files which should be ignored
		:param bool sort: Boolean flag to indicate if the lines in the files should be sorted prior to the comparison
		:param list[(regexp:str,repl:str),...]replace: List of tuples of the form ('regexpr', 'replacement'). For each regular expression in the 
			list, any occurences in the files are replaced with the replacement value prior to the comparison being 
			carried out. This is often useful to replace timestamps in logfiles etc.
		:param bool stripWhitespace: If True, every line has leading and trailing whitespace stripped before comparison, 
			which means indentation differences and whether the file ends with a blank line do not affect the outcome.

			Only the first line matching this expression will be considered, so ensure the ``grepRegex`` should 
			be "just specific enough" to uniquely identify the required line, but without duplicating the verification 
			to be performed with the conditionstring assertion. 
		
		:param str conditionstring: A string containing Python code that will be evaluated using ``eval()`` 
			to validate that "value" is correct. For example ``value == expected``.
			
			It's best to put expected values into a separate named parameter (rather than using literals inside the 
			conditionstring), since this will produce more informative messages if there is a failure. 
			
			Do not be tempted to use a Python f-string here, as that would deprive PySys of the 
			opportunity to provide a self-describing message and outcome reason. 

		:param List[callable[str]->str] mappers: A list of filter functions that will be used to pre-process each 
			line from the file (returning None if the line is to be filtered out). This provides a very powerful 
			capability for filtering the file, for example `pysys.mappers.IncludeLinesBetween` 
			provides the ability to filter in/out sections of a file. 
			
			Do not share mapper instances across multiple tests or threads as this can cause race conditions. 
			
		:param str encoding: The encoding to use to open the file. 
			The default value is None which indicates that the decision will be delegated 
			to the L{getDefaultFileEncoding()} method. 
		
		:param int reFlags: Zero or more flags controlling how the behaviour of regular expression matching,

			For details see the ``re`` module in the Python standard library. Note that ``re.MULTILINE`` cannot

		:param bool abortOnError: Set to True to make the test immediately abort if the

		r"""Perform a validation by checking for the presence or absence of a regular expression in the specified text file.

		The assertGrep method is good for checking in a log to confirm that something happened, or to check that 
		there are no error messages. 
		
		Note that if your goal is to check that a value in the file matches some criteria, it is better to 
		use `assertThatGrep` or `assertGrepOfGrep` instead of this function, as these methods indicate the intention 
		more clearly, produce better messages on failure, and in the case of `assertThatGrep` 
		also allow for more powerful matching using a full Python expression 
		(e.g. numeric range checks, pre-processing strings to normalize case or path separators, etc). 
	
		When contains=True this method adds a `PASSED <pysys.constants.PASSED>` outcome if found or a 
		`FAILED <pysys.constants.FAILED>` outcome if not found (except when where are named groups in the expression 
		in which case `BLOCKED <pysys.constants.BLOCKED>` is used to indicate that the return value is not valid).
		When contains=False this is inverted so a `PASSED <pysys.constants.PASSED>` outcome is added if not found 
		and `FAILED <pysys.constants.FAILED>` if found. 

		For example::
		
			self.assertGrep('myserver.log', r' ERROR .*', contains=False)

			# If error messages may be accompanied by stack traces you can use a mapper to join them into the same line 
			# so if your test fails, the outcome reason includes all the information. This also allows ignoring errors 
			# based on the stack trace:
			self.assertGrep('myserver.log', r' (ERROR|FATAL) .*', contains=False, 
				mappers=[pysys.mappers.JoinLines.JavaStackTrace()], 	
				ignores=['Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeError: My expected exception'])
			
			# In Python 3+, f-Strings can be used to substitute in parameters, including in-line escaping of regex literals:
			# (but assertThatGrep is a better choice here)
			self.assertGrep('myserver.log', f'Successfully authenticated user "{re.escape(username)}" in .* seconds[.]')
			
			# If you need to use \ characters use a raw r'...' string to avoid the need for Python \ escaping in 
			# addition to regex escaping. Square brackets are often the clearest way to escape regular expression 
			# characters such as \ . and ()
			self.assertGrep('myserver.log', r'c:[\]Foo[\]bar[.]txt')
			
			# The IncludeLinesBetween mapper is very useful if you want to grep within a subset of the lines:
			self.assertGrep('myserver.log', r'MyClass', mappers=[
				pysys.mappers.IncludeLinesBetween('Error message.* - stack trace is:', stopBefore='^$'),
			])
		
		The behaviour of the regular expression can be controlled using ``reFlags=``. For example, to perform 
		case-insensitive matching and to use Python's verbose regular expression syntax which permits whitespace 
		and comments::
			
			self.assertGrep('myserver.log', reFlags=re.VERBOSE | re.IGNORECASE, expr=r\"""
				in\   
				\d +  # the integral part
				\.    # the decimal point
				\d *  # some fractional digits
				\ seconds\. # in verbose regex mode we escape spaces with a slash
				\""")

		Remember to escape regular expression special characters such as ``.``, ``(``, ``[``, ``{`` and ``\`` if you want them to 
		be treated as literal values. If you have a regular expression string with backslashes, it's best to use a 'raw' 
		Python string so that you don't need to double-escape them, e.g. ``self.assertGrep(..., expr=r'c:\\Foo\\filename\.txt')``.
		
		If you want to search for a string that needs lots of regex escaping, a nice trick is to use a 
		substitution string (containing only A-Z chars) for the regex special characters and pass everything else 
		through re.escape::
		
			self.assertGrep('myserver.log', re.escape(r'A"string[with \lots*] of crazy characters e.g. VALUE.').replace('VALUE', '(.*)'))

		If you need to extract a string for further processing without performing an assertion and 
		updating the test outcome, see the using `grep` instead. 

		.. versionchanged:: 1.5.1
			The return value and reFlags were added in 1.5.1.

		:param file: The name or relative/absolute path of the file to be searched.
		
		:param str expr: The regular expression to check for in the file (or a string literal if literal=True), 
			for example ``" ERROR .*"``. 
			
			Remember to escape regular expression special characters such as ``.``, ``(``, ``[``, ``{`` and ``\`` if you want them to 
			be treated as literal values. 
			
			If you wish to do something with the text inside the match you can use the ``re`` named 
			group syntax ``(?P<groupName>...)`` to specify a name for parts of the regular expression.
			
			For contains=False matches, you should end the expr with `.**` if you wish to include just the 
			matching text in the outcome failure reason. If contains=False and expr does not end with a `*` 
			then the entire matching line will be included in the outcome failure reason. 
		
		:param bool contains: Boolean flag to specify if the expression should or should not be seen in the file.
		
		:param list[str] ignores: Optional list of regular expressions that will be 
			ignored when reading the file. Ignore expressions are applied *after* any mappers. 
		
		:param List[callable[str]->str] mappers: A list of filter functions that will be used to pre-process each 
			line from the file (returning None if the line is to be filtered out). This provides a very powerful 
			capability for filtering the file, for example `pysys.mappers.IncludeLinesBetween` 
			provides the ability to filter in/out sections of a file and `pysys.mappers.JoinLines` can combine related 
			error lines such as stack trace to provide all the information in the test outcome reason. 
			
			Mappers must always preserve the final ``\n`` of each line (if present). 
			
			Do not share mapper instances across multiple tests or threads as this can cause race conditions. 
			
			Added in PySys 1.6.0.
		
		:param bool literal: By default expr is treated as a regex, but set this to True to pass in 
			a string literal instead.
		
		:param str encoding: The encoding to use to open the file. 
			The default value is None which indicates that the decision will be delegated 
			to the L{getDefaultFileEncoding()} method. 
		
		:param bool abortOnError: Set to True to make the test immediately abort if the
			assertion fails. 
		
		:param str assertMessage: An additional high-level description of what this assertion is checking, 
			e.g. "Check for expected error message". 
			Used in log messages and the outcome reason. 

		:param str filedir: The directory of the file (defaults to the testcase output subdirectory); this is 
			deprecated, as it's simpler to just include the directory in the file parameter. 

		:param int reFlags: Zero or more flags controlling how the behaviour of regular expression matching, 
			combined together using the ``|`` operator, for example ``reFlags=re.VERBOSE | re.IGNORECASE``. 
			
			For details see the ``re`` module in the Python standard library. Note that ``re.MULTILINE`` cannot 
			be used because expressions are matched against one line at a time. Added in PySys 1.5.1. 
			
		:return: The ``re.Match`` object, or None if there was no match (note the return value is not affected by 
			the contains=True/False parameter). 
			
			However if the expr contains any ``(?P<groupName>...)`` named groups, then a dict is returned 
			containing ``dict(groupName: str, matchValue: str or None)`` (or an empty ``{}`` dict if there is no match) 
			which allows the assertGrep result to be passed to `assertThat` for further checking (typically 
			unpacked using the ``**`` operator; see example above).

			self.reportPerformanceResult(int(iterations)/float(calctime),

		If your test runs in multiple modes, make sure you include some information about the mode in the resultKey::

			self-describing (without the need to look up extra information such as the associated testId). Do not include
			the test id or units in the resultKey string. It must be stable across different runs, so cannot contain
			process identifiers, date/times or other numbers that will vary. If possible resultKeys should be written
			so that related results will be together when all performance results are sorted by resultKey, which usually
			means putting general information near the start of the string and specifics (throughput/latency, sending/receiving)
			towards the end of the string. It should be as concise as possible (given the above).

		:param unit: Identifies the unit the value is measured in, including whether bigger numbers are better or
			worse (used to determine improvement or regression). Must be an instance of L{pysys.perf.api.PerformanceUnit}.
			In most cases, use L{pysys.perf.api.PerformanceUnit.SECONDS} (e.g. for latency) or
			L{pysys.perf.api.PerformanceUnit.PER_SECOND} (e.g. for throughput); the string literals 's' and '/s' can be
