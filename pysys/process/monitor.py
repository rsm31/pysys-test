	wrapper around a Python library that provides a wider set of monitoring 
	statistics, such as psutil. The fields and methods starting with a 
	single underscore `_` can be used or overridden by custom subclasses. 
	To start the process monitor from a custom class, simply ensure you have 
	passed the owner basetest to its constructor and then call the L{start} 
	method. 

	Monitors are automatically terminated during cleanup at the end 
	of a test, or can be manually stopped before that using the L{stop} method.
