	The method reads in the files and loads the contents of each as a list of strings. The two files are 
	said to be equal if the two lists are equal. The method allows for preprocessing of the string lists 
	to trim down their contents prior to the comparison being performed. Preprocessing is either to remove 
	entries from the lists which match any entry in a set of regular expressions, include only lines which 
	match any entry in a set of regular expressions, replace certain keywords in the string values of each list
	with a set value (e.g. to replace time stamps etc), or to sort the lists before the comparison (e.g. where 
	determinism may not exist). Verbose logging of the method occurs at DEBUG level showing the contents of the 
	processed lists prior to the comparison being performed.

	:param replacementList: A list of tuples (key, value) where matches to key are replaced with value in the input file contents before making the comparison
	:param stripWhitespace: If True, every line has leading and trailing whitespace stripped before comparison,

		If False, only newline characters are stripped.
