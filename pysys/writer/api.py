"""
API for creating new writers. 

Writers are responsible for summarising test results or processing test output as each test completes, or at the end 
when all tests has completed. 

The most common type of writer is the standard 'Record' writer, but there are also 'Progress', and
'Summary' writers which do their things at different stages of the test run:

   - `BaseRecordResultsWriter`: **Record writers** record the outcome or output of tests, allowing 
     runtime auditing of the test output, e.g. into text file, a database, or to the console in a format that 
     can be read by your Continuous Integration (CI) tooling, or collection/archiving of test output files. 
     
     Several record writers are distributed with the PySys framework, such as the 
     `pysys.writer.outcomes.JUnitXMLResultsWriter` and `pysys.writer.ci.GitHubActionsCIWriter`.
     By default, record writers are enabled only when the ``--record`` flag is given to the PySys launcher, 
     though some writers may enable/disable themselves under different conditions, by overriding the 
     L{BaseResultsWriter.isEnabled} method.

   - `BaseProgressResultsWriter`: **Progress writers** output a summary of the test progress after completion of each test, to give
     an indication of how far and how well the run is progressing. A single implementation of a progress
     writer is distributed with the PySys framework, namely the `pysys.writer.console.ConsoleProgressResultsWriter`,
     which details the percentage of tests selected to be run and that have executed, and a summary
     of the recent test failures. 
     Progress writers should extend the `BaseProgressResultsWriter` and
     are enabled when the ``--progress`` flag is given to the PySys launcher, or when ``PYSYS_PROGRESS=true`` is
     set in the local environment.

   - `BaseSummaryResultsWriter`: **Summary writers** output an overall summary of the status at the end of a test run. 
     A single implementation of a summary writer is distributed with the PySys framework, namely the 
     `pysys.writer.console.ConsoleSummaryResultsWriter`, which details the overall test run outcome and lists any tests 
     that did not pass. 
     Summary writers are always enabled regardless of the flags given to the PySys launcher.

(See also `pysys.perf.api` whcih is used for writing performance results, using a similar but slightly 
different API).

Project configuration of the writers is through the PySys project XML file using the ``<writer>`` tag. Multiple
writers may be configured and their individual properties set through the nested ``<property>`` tag. Writer
properties are set as attributes to the writer instance just before setup is called, with automatic conversion of 
type to match the default value if specified as a static attribute on the class. 

The writers are instantiated and invoked by the L{pysys.baserunner.BaseRunner} class instance. This calls the class
constructors of all configured test writers, and then the setup (prior to executing the set of tests), processResult
(process a test result), and cleanup (upon completion of the execution of all tests). The ``**kwargs`` method parameter
should always be included in the signature of each method, to allow for future additions to PySys without
breaking existing writer implementations.

Writers that generate output files/directories should by default put that output under either the 
`runner.output <pysys.baserunner.BaseRunner>` directory, or (for increased prominence) the ``runner.output+'/..'`` 
directory (which is typically ``testRootDir`` unless an absolute ``--outdir`` path was provided) . 
A prefix of double underscore ``__pysys`` is recommended to distinguish dynamically created directories 
(ignored by version control) from the testcase directories (checked into version control). 

Writer authors may wish to make use of these helpers:
